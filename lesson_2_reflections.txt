What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Initialize a repository creates an empty Git repository. You need to do this in order to set up for tracking your files and creating a git log of changes between versions. The repository holds "backups".

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is different because it's where you are setting up its files to be committed. You assign via 'git add' command which files to be staged for the repository.

The staging area offers a benefit of grouping multiple files together for a single commit. (Can you also remove from staging area? If so, the benefit is generally more control over your commits.)
