When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would use a remote repository when I am working from a different computer online, or when I am working on something from someone else's GitHub repository.

=====================================================================

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Pull changes manually so that the updates are intentional and specific with regards to your objectives.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork: clone within GitHub server & links back to original GitHub repository; use when you are working on a repository posted via Github and you want to work on your own version of it linking back

Clone: copy of version with commit history (git log); can be forked or on cloned to your own computer; use when you need your own copy from a repository from GitHub

Branches: Version history with each commit tracing back to its parent, and head is the current commit; use to track changes, fix bugs, modify features, update
