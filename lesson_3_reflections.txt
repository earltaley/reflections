When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would use a remote repository when I am working from a different computer online, or when I am working on something from someone else's GitHub repository.

=====================================================================

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Pull changes manually so that the updates are intentional and specific with regards to your objectives.
